**Describe the bug**
Video embedded subtitles do not work while casting to a tv/chromecast, i have tested on various Operative systems also, not exclusive to ubuntu, 
for movies its not a problem due to there are a lot of external subtittles, but for animes it is, since you cannot cast and have to watch it on the device.
appreciate the help, awsome app, thanyou so much in advance.

**To Reproduce**
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
Open any video with embedded subtitles (most animes have them, in case you dont have a video like that)
cast video to a chromecast or android tv
you'll see the subtitles option on smartphone / pc dissapear, since it only cast downloaded subtitles.

**Expected behavior**
Subtitle option still present in the device to select.
Subtitles being casted to tv / chromecast.
